A basic Overhaul for Minecraft. This fabric mod will be open source and anyone can have an input, if you can code you can create. You don't have to be an artist to add features, I'm happy to make models and textures for anything, the only rule: "Try and Keep as Vanilla as possible, but push that to it's limits."

Feel free to add anything as long as it's appropriate, there will be constant backups so if you do find yourself making trolls, your file will be deleted if they do not deem fit.
